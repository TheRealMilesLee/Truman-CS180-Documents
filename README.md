This is the supporting documents and notes for the truman CS180 course

# Index
[Test 1](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%201.docx) This is the first test of this course, it contains chapter 1 - 3, and for the lab is the lab1 - lab4. The main knowledge points were: data type, variable definition, random function, cin and cout, do basic math in variables with different data types, and write a full program that contains all these above.

[Test 2](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%202.docx) This is the second test of this course, it contains chapter 4 - 6, and for the lab is the lab5 - lab8. The main knowledge points were: Truth table, abs function and EPSILON methond to compare two double values that they are equal or not. Also, in this test contains the validation for the user input and the biggest-smallest comparsion algorithm. This test tests your ability to write the Javadoc and identify three different loop structure's difference.

[Test 3](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%203.docx) This is the third test of this course, it contains chapter 6 - 8, and for the lab is the lab9 - lab12. The main knowledge points were: Bubble sort algorithm, linear search algorithm, array, binary search algorithm, vector, pointer, Javadoc and the prototype of a function, the function call and the graph of how the parameter doing.

[Test 4](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%204.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 1

[Test 5](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%205.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 2

[Test 6](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%206.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 1, 2 3

[CS180 Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/CS180%20C%2B%2B%20Language%20Coding%20Style%20Guide.pdf) This guide you how to code in appropriate way

# Terms and concepts

This is the full term and the concepts notes in the Fall 2019, CS180 course.

#### Chapter 1

In this chapter, it just telling about the basics of how computer work, here is 5 important part that needs to be take care of:

1. Hardware components: What construct the computer

2. Main memory: the random access memory and its address

3. Kinds of values that can be stored in the memory: Like the integers, floating number and the string.

4. The language that be used to programming: For this course, we only learn C++.

#### Chapter 2

In this chapter, the variables and the data types were the two most important parts that we learned in this chapter. The data types is a set of values with a set of operations that defined values. In the C++ language, we have various values, e.g. integer, char, string, float, bool and so on.

Also, in this chapter, we mentioned about the operations that you can do in the c++ language. The unary minus, addition, subtraction, and the multiplication just work as the way you think. 

#### Chapter 3
 
In this chapter,the stream extraction operator is the most important part among this chapter, it reads data from standard input and converts it to the type of the variable. The mathematical operations are avilable from the <cmath> library, including the pow function. What's more the overflow and the underflow can result from arithmetic operations. Mixtype to do the math is not recommend, if you really need to do that, please use the static_cast<> to cast the types.

For the formatting, output, you can use the setw(), fixed, setprecision() and the showpoint functions to reformatting the output files.

Chapter 4

In this chapter, what your need to take care of is the relational operators and the bool type. The if, if-else, if-elseif-else were also the most important idea points in this chapter.

For the if statement, the logical operators is the anoty
