[Test 1](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%201.docx) This is the first test of this course, it contains chapter 1 - 3, and for the lab is the lab1 - lab4. The main knowledge points were: data type, variable definition, random function, cin and cout, do basic math in variables with different data types, and write a full program that contains all these above.

[Test 2](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%202.docx) This is the second test of this course, it contains chapter 4 - 6, and for the lab is the lab5 - lab8. The main knowledge points were: Truth table, abs function and EPSILON methond to compare two double values that they are equal or not. Also, in this test contains the validation for the user input and the biggest-smallest comparsion algorithm. This test tests your ability to write the Javadoc and identify three different loop structure's difference.

[Test 3](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%203.docx) This is the third test of this course, it contains chapter 6 - 8, and for the lab is the lab9 - lab12. The main knowledge points were: Bubble sort algorithm, linear search algorithm, array, binary search algorithm, vector, pointer, Javadoc and the prototype of a function, the function call and the graph of how the parameter doing.

[Test 4](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%204.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 1

[Test 5](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%205.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 2

[Test 6](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/Test%206.docx) This is the Mistake collection from test 1, 2 3

[CS180 Coding Style Guide](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/CS180%20C%2B%2B%20Language%20Coding%20Style%20Guide.pdf) This guide you how to code in appropriate way

[CS180 Notes](https://github.com/TheRealMilesLee/Truman-CS180-Documents/blob/master/CS180%20%E7%9F%A5%E8%AF%86%E7%82%B9%E6%A2%B3%E7%90%86.pdf) This is the knowledge point collection for the whole course, it is the most important documents that needs to be go through in this course
